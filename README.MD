# Deril's Mansion extended - behind the locked door


* Ever wondered who Deril's guests are and what exactly lies behind the locked door in his mansion?
* Ever felt disappointed that his threats of "dealing with you later" never come to fruition?

This mod expands Cernd's quest finale in case you go down the "peaceful" path during your encounter 
with Deril, effectively leading up to Lagole Gon showing up and the two of them escaping after
handing over Cernd's child.

Following the resolution, Cernd voices his concerns over letting Deril go and you
are then presented with two choices of how you want to address his potential return.


### Option 1 - Preemptive Strike
You agree with Cernd that exposing yourselves to an ambush might not be the best idea.
You two decide to meet up in Druid's Grove in 1 day, then 
head back to Deril's mansion to finish him before he attacks you first.

But it seems the meeting he was holding that day has not yet concluded...

### Option 2 - Come at me bro
You tell Cernd that you're not interested in returning to the mansion.
You'll worry about Deril if he actually decides to carry out his threats.

This time though, Deril is a man of his word. He hasn't forgotten about you
and as soon as he makes some time, you might wake up to a surprise.
