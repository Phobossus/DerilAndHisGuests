# Deril is killed, quest isn't started
    1. First Encounter with Deril
    - End up killing him
    - Meet Cernd in Grove

    Quest should not be initiated.
    a) No additional dialog with Cernd in Grove
    b) No Thavin in Deril's mansion
    c) No Ambush encounter in 4 days

# Deril and Lagole escape, quest is started
    - Case 1: Directly accepted the quest (Yes Cernd let's come back here)
    Quest should be initiated.
    a) Additional dialog with Cernd in Grove

    - Case 2: Indirectly accepted the quest (No Cernd let's wait for ambush)
    Quest should be initiated.
    a) No additional dialog with Cernd in Grove

    Case 1 & 2:
    a) Thavin in Deril's mansion in 1 day
    b) Ambush encounter in 4 days

# Ambush encounter
   1. Trigger during rest after 4 days
   - Thavin there, if Thavin hasn't already been killed
   - No Thavin, if Thavin has been killed
   2. Killing all Pillar members opens up the clickable portal outside
   - Cernd comments after we are back from Ambush
   - Thavin is not in Mansion
   - Door to Guest Room is locked
   - Next rest is normal

# Guest room encounter
   1. Killing Thavin opens up the door
   2. Pillar members confrontation
   a) Hurting any pillar member before they talk to you, ends up in hostile encounter with all of them and no talking
   - This scenario should play out same way as if you talked to them and led the conversation to a fight
     (Larottle karsomir, seal broken, quest solved, cernd comments)
   b) Killing Deril and not hurting pillar members initiated the standard dialog
   - Peaceful resolution works
   - Hostile resolution works (no carsomyr)
   - Hostile resolution works (carsomyr)
   3. Ambush should not happen after this is resolved

# Other things to confirm
- Larottle - does escape script work properly in all areas, even while he's being focused by everyone? (make sure no delay)
- Can Verissa's belt be used by all classes? (test on minsc/jaheira)

# Naming convention
- rename file names when there's a risk of conflict with other mods, maybe some global variable names too
